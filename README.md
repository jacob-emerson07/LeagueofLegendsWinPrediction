## Objective:
  The goal of this project is to figure out if one could make a model that can predict the winning team of a League of Legends game simply by analyzing the stats at the 10 minute mark.
  
## Results:
  After testing the results from four different ML Models (SVC, LinearSVC, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier), it was determined the Logistic Regression  model predicted the outcome of a match the best with an accuracy score of ~.731 and a cross validation score of ~.717.
